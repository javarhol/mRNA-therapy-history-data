# mRNA-therapy-history-data
 dataset pulled from clinicaltrials.gov, without COVID-19 therapies

This is the dataset used for an article posted on speakingofresearch.com and includes code for producing the associated graph. 

The data were pulled from: [clinicaltrials.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?cond=&term=&type=&rslt=&age_v=&gndr=&intr=&titles=mRNA&outc=&spons=&lead=&id=&cntry=&state=&city=&dist=&locn=&rsub=&strd_s=01%2F01%2F2020&strd_e=&prcd_s=&prcd_e=&sfpd_s=&sfpd_e=&rfpd_s=&rfpd_e=&lupd_s=&lupd_e=&sort=nwst) with specific search terms for "mRNA" in the title of the clinical trial. Therapies for COVID-19 were excluded for the point of the article. 

The dataset will be updated each year for subsequent articles (I hope).
